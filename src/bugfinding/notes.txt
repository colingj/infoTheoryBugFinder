programs are of the format:

variable v0
variable v1
variable v2
variable v3
f1 = XOR v0 v1
f2 = XOR v2 v3
f3 = XOR f1 f2
output f3

# with comments on lines starting with
# and empty lines being ignored


*****************************************************************************

We might want to refactor this so that the comment lines are cut out earlier;
they form a large burden in terms of keeping track of "null"s all over the place
etc.
